`New classroom Config`

This classroom build is created with Ubuntu 16.04 in mind. It could work with previous version, but there is no promise that it will work. If you happen to try and use it on a Distro that is not Ubuntu 16.04 and it works please let me know and I will update. The end goal is to support Debian :Debian: and RedHat :tophat: trees :evergreen_tree:
